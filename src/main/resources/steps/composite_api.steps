Composite: When I delete the board with $boardId via API
When I execute HTTP DELETE request for resource with relative URL `/1/boards/<boardId>?key=${key}&token=${token}`
Then response code is equal to `200`
Then JSON element from `${response}` by JSON path `$._value` is equal to  `null`
When I set request headers:
|name        |value           |
|Content-Type|application/json|
When I execute HTTP GET request for resource with relative URL `/1/boards/<boardId>?key=${key}&token=${token}`
Then response code is equal to `404`
